## About the Video Course
Today's bots can help us order food, shop for clothes, save money, and find restaurants. For example, Digit helps you manage your money by showing your bank balance, upcoming bills, and helping you save money through text messages. 

In this video, now that you have a good understanding of the different components and their role in the overall environment, we will start to delve into more advanced features. This video course will show how to add conversational logic to a bot by using LUIS and covers the basics, setting up Visual Studio, and exploring the LUIS User Interface, ending with building a demo bot using LUIS. We then move onto publishing your bot to Azure as well as deployment into different channels. You will finish the course by building your own bot using the knowledge gained from previous sections.
